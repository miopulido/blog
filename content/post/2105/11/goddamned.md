The Goddamned is a brand new comic from writer Jason Aaron, artist r.m. Guera,
with colors by Giulia Brusco, and published by Image Comics.

The comic's main character is Cain and the setting is 1,600 years after [Eden]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_of_Eden). For those who don't know,
[Cain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain_and_Abel) is the son of Adam and Eve
from the Bible and the worlds' first murderer.  While Eden refers to the Garden
of Eden.  I'm assuming 1,600 years after Eden refers to the number of years it
has been since Adam and Eve were banished from the Garden.

Now that we've got that out of the way let's talk about the comic!  It appears
that 1,600 years after Eden, the world is in a horrible state.  The current
story arc's setting is in a desert.  The characters in the story are basically
cavemen and because of this the artwork has a very crude and gritty feel.  I
like it.

Cain is immortal.  It is a curse that was placed on him by God.  Now he wanders
the world looking for ways to end his curse, i.e. die.  There is a lot of
action that takes place in this first issue as Cain takes revenge on a group of
savages that attacked and left him for dead.  Over the course of the issue Cain
mentions [Nephilims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim).  For those that
don't know, Nephilim are giants who are offsprings of Angels and humans.  These
are probably future enemies of Cain.  In the very last page of the comic we are
introduced to the first major villain, [Noah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah).

Wow.  What a way to kick things off.  Cain as the protagonist, while Noah as an
antagonist and a lumberjack to boot!  Talk about role reversal.  I can't wait
to see how the story unfolds. I definitely recommend picking this comic book up.
